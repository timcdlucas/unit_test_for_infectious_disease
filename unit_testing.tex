\section{ example}

Consider a multistrain system, where a population of $N$ individuals who get reinfected once per time step. 
Each individual is defined by the strain they are currently infected with $I_{it} \in \{'a', 'b', 'c'\}$ and so the the population is defined by the length $N$ vector of states $\mathbf{I_t}$.
Then each time step, the infection status of each individual is updated
$$I_{it} = Unif(\mathbf{I{t-1}).$$

Here then is our first attempt at implementing this model.

N <- 99
T <- 200
I <- matrix(NA, ncom = N, nrow = T)
I[1, ] <- rep(c("a", "b", "c"), N / 3)

for(t in seq(2, T)){
  I[t, ] <- sample(I[t - 1, ], N)
}
