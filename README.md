A primer on unit testing for infectious disease models
=======================================================


A concise overview of unit testing. 

Focus on the specific difficulties in infectious disease models such as stochastic events.

Work through a short but relevant example.

Cover testing frameworks for R, Julia and maybe Python as well. 
So testthat and the Test module in Julia.
Hopefully demonstrate how to do tests for both a simple script and a package. 

Aim to publish in Epidemics.
