A primer on unit testing for infectious disease models
=======================================================


A concise overview of unit testing.

Focus on the specific difficulties in infectious disease models such as stochastic events.

Work through a short but relevant example.

Cover testing frameworks for R, Julia and maybe Python as well.
So testthat and the Test module in Julia.
Hopefully demonstrate how to do tests for both a simple script and a package.

Aim to publish in Epidemics.
There are basically no formatting requirements for first submission to epidemics.
So just a simple tex doc with as little extra as possible.
We will need code so need to work out the best way to do that.
